In React, hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Here are some of the most commonly used hooks:

1. **useState**: 
   - Allows you to add state to functional components.
   - Returns a stateful value and a function to update it.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
     ```

2. **useEffect**:
   - Lets you perform side effects in function components (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions).
   - Can be used to mimic lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     useEffect(() => {
       document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
     }, [count]); // Only re-run the effect if count changes
     ```

3. **useContext**:
   - Accepts a context object (returned from `React.createContext`) and returns the current context value.
   - Useful for passing data deeply throughout the component tree without prop drilling.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
     ```

4. **useReducer**:
   - An alternative to `useState` for managing complex state logic.
   - Similar to Redux, it takes a reducer function and an initial state, returning the current state and a dispatch function.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
     ```

5. **useRef**:
   - Returns a mutable ref object whose `.current` property is initialized with the passed argument.
   - Useful for accessing DOM elements or storing mutable values.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const inputRef = useRef(null);
     ```

6. **useMemo**:
   - Returns a memoized value, recomputing it only when dependencies change.
   - Useful for optimizing performance by preventing expensive calculations on every render.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
     ```

7. **useCallback**:
   - Returns a memoized callback function, which only changes if one of the dependencies has changed.
   - Useful for optimizing child components that rely on function props.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
       doSomething(a, b);
     }, [a, b]);
     ```

8. **useLayoutEffect**:
   - Similar to `useEffect` but fires synchronously after all DOM mutations.
   - Useful for measuring layout and synchronously re-rendering.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     useLayoutEffect(() => {
       // Code that requires DOM measurements
     }, []);
     ```

9. **useImperativeHandle**:
   - Customizes the instance value that is exposed when using `ref` with a component.
   - Should be used with `forwardRef`.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
       focus: () => {
         inputRef.current.focus();
       },
     }));
     ```

These hooks are foundational in React and cover a wide range of use cases, from managing state and side effects to optimizing performance and working with refs.
